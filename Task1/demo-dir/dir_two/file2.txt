The algorithm is dependent on the available algorithms supported by the version of OpenSSL on the platform. 
Examples are 'sha256', 'sha512', etc. On recent releases of OpenSSL, openssl list -digest-algorithms 
(openssl list-message-digest-algorithms for older versions of OpenSSL) will display the available digest 
algorithms.

The key is the HMAC key used to generate the cryptographic HMAC hash. If it is a KeyObject, 
its type must be secret.
