Asynchronously computes the canonical pathname by resolving ., .. and symbolic links.

A canonical pathname is not necessarily unique. Hard links and bind mounts can expose a file system 
entity through many pathnames.

This function behaves like realpath(3), with some exceptions:

No case conversion is performed on case-insensitive file systems.

The maximum number of symbolic links is platform-independent and generally (much) higher than what the 
native realpath(3) implementation supports.

The callback gets two arguments (err, resolvedPath). May use process.cwd to resolve relative paths.

Only paths that can be converted to UTF8 strings are supported.

The optional options argument can be a string specifying an encoding, or an object with an encoding
 property specifying the character encoding to use for the path passed to the callback. 
 If the encoding is set to 'buffer', the path returned will be passed as a Buffer object.

If path resolves to a socket or a pipe, the function will return a system dependent name 
for that object.
